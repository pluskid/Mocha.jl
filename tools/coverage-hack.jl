# The julia Coverage count all files in src by default. However, our
# CUDA/OpenCL components are only tested locally because the Travis-CI does
# not have GPU devices. This caused the coverage of Mocha to be very
# low. We add a simple hacking that allow us to ignore the "cuda" and "opencl"
# sub-directories to fix the coverage reporting.
