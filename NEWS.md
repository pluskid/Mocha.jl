## v0.0.7 2015.02.27

* Infrastructure
  * Boltzmann.jl now supports DBN pre-training for Mocha.jl
  * Clearer Nesterov solver (@the-moliver)
  * Staged momentum policy
  * Learning rate policy to decay dynamically based on performance on validation set
* Network
  * Async HDF5 data layer: faster and with chunking to support fast data shuffling
  * Softlabel-softmax-loss layer allows training with posterior (instead of hard labels) as labels
  * Weight loss layers to combine multiple loss functions in one network
  * Square loss layer is now capable of propagating gradients to both sides

## v0.0.6 2014.12.31

* Infrastructure
  * Numerical gradient checking in unit-tests (@pcmoritz)
  * Simple ref-counting for shared parameters
* Network
  * RandomMaskLayer, TiedInnerProductLayer, IdentityLayer
  * Freezing / unfreezing some layers of a network to allow layer-wise pre-training
* Documentation
  * A new tutorial on MNIST that compares unsupervised pre-training via stacked denoising auto-encoders and random initialization

## v0.0.5 2014.12.20

* Infrastructure
  * **{Breaking Changes}** cuDNN 6.5 R2 (Release Candidate) (@JobJob)
    * cuDNN 6.5 R2 is **NOT** backward compatible with 6.5 R1
    * Forward convolution speed up
    * Pooling with padding is supported
    * Mac OS X is supported
  * 4D-tensor -> ND-tensor
    * Mocha is now capable of handling general ND-tensor
    * Except that (for now) `ConvolutionLayer` and `PoolingLayer` still requires the inputs to be 4D
    * The generalization is *almost* backward compatible, except
      * The interface for `ReshapeLayer` changed b/c the target shape needs to be ND, instead of 4D now
      * Parameters added for some layers to allow the user to specify which dimension to operate on
      * The output of `InnerProductLayer` is now 2D-tensor instead of 4D
    * Unit-tests are expanded to cover test cases for ND-tensor when applicable
* Interface
  * print a constructed `Net` to get a brief overview of the geometry of input/output blobs in each layers
* Documentation
  * Setup the [Roadmap Ticket](https://github.com/pluskid/Mocha.jl/issues/22), duscussions/suggestions are welcome
  * Update everything to reflect 4D -> ND tensor changes
  * Document for parameter norm constraints
  * Developer's Guide for blob and layer API
